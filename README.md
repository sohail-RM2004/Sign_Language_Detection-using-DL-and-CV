## Abstract

This project presents a real-time sign language recognition system that converts American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures into text using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system employs a Custom CNN to classify 29 hand gestures (Aâ€“Z, space, delete, nothing) with high accuracy. Using MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing, it delivers efficient gesture recognition suitable for accessibility applications. GUI and CLI interfaces, along with text-to-speech functionality, enhance user experience.

## ðŸ“„ Conclusion

This project shows the successful development of a real-time ASL recognition system using CNNs and transfer learn-ing. The system reached about 96.7% accuracy, worked at 25â€“30 FPS, and used efficient hand tracking with a lightweight model, making it suitable for normal computers.
The system is useful as an assistive tool, with both command-line and GUI options, along with text-to-speech for better accessibility. While it currently handles static gestures, it can be extended to support dynamic gestures and multi-hand recognition.
